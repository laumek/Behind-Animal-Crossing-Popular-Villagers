# Behind-Animal-Crossing-Popular-Villagers

Embarking on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this project focuses on Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) villager data. Initially scraped using Selenium and Beautiful Soup, we delve into the popularity of virtual villagers. By scrutinising attributes like personality, appearance, rarity, and more, our goal is to unearth correlations that explain a villager's popularity. Through statistical analysis and visualisations, this EDA offers insights into player preferences within the virtual world, providing valuable information for both Animal Crossing enthusiasts and researchers intrigued by digital community dynamics.
